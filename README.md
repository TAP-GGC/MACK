## 🤖 Technology
The technologies used in this project are HTML, CSS, QR Code, NFC, and APIs.
   1. ### HTML, CSS
  HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to structure the content of a webpage, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and visually design that content—defining layout, colors, fonts, and more.
  
  2.  ### NFC Chips
  NFC (Near Field Communication) chips are compact microchips that allow devices to exchange data wirelessly over short distances. Commonly used in contactless payments and digital sharing, they enable quick and seamless communication between compatible devices.
